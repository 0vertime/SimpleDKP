# SimpleDKP
an unfinished project by Luma

This addon was used by Honorable on Emerald Dream, Feenix.
It's made exclusively for our loot rules, so only advanced users should find this useful.
I will not update this addon.

Available commands:

/start {itemLink}
eg.: /start [Scarlet Kris]

Starts a fully automatic auction. Working with core raider priorities. Only exception is warrior tank loot core prio thing, but no issue so far.

/award {amount} {name}
eg.: /award -50 Luma
eg.: /award 25 Zeraton

Awards the DKP amount to the player. Negative values are shown with - sign, player names are case sensitive with capitalised first letter.

/attendance

No parameters for this command. Awards 50 DKP to everyone online at the time of the command. Alts online gets awarded on main, socials don't get awarded. You only get awarded once.

/alt {mainName} {altName}
eg.: /alt Luma Rosalina

Note the player names are case sensitive with capitalised first letter here as well. Connects an alt and main with correct syntax.
